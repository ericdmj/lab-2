### Title: _Turnout By Election: A Virginia Story_

### Description:

My main question is this:

I did Activity 10 as written, but because my data shows 133 municipalities instead of the 22 units shown in the France example, my bar graph is kind of silly and narrow.  You can see my original Activity 10 version on [my Github](https://github.com/ericdmj/unit-3/) or even easier by going to my [Pages version](https://ericdmj.github.io/unit-3/).

So I thought I might try it with a different layout.  Would something like the following work, with some additional formatting?

* [Lab 2 on my Github, which is where you are right now](https://github.com/ericdmj/lab-2/)
* [Lab 2 on Pages](https://ericdmj.github.io/lab-2/)

All other thoughts are very welcome!
